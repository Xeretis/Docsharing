# Docsharing

A full stack application originally intended for file sharing but ended up being a little more.
It's kind of inspired by google classroom with spaces that can be joined using a corresponding code or
invite link and posts that can be created in spaces.

It's my first laravel project where I actually got to the point of implementing everything I originally wanted
so don't blame me for the somewhat poor code quality.
